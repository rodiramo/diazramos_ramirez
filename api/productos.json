"product_description": "Philodendron Melanochrysum is striking even among the stunning lineup that is the Philodendron family and is sometimes referred to as the Black Gold Philodendron because of the beautiful gold accents on her leaves. Her leaves, which start out like a fleshy pink before turning almost black with age, get bigger and bigger as she gets taller, so you can enjoy them even more! She is a climber so will be happiest when she has something like a mossy stick to climb up. This weird plant blends exotic and refined and will be the centerpiece of any display. Even though it can be very tempting to start your plant collection with this beauty, we would recommend starting with a different plant if you are a beginner plant parent. Also, take note that every plant is unique and not all plants will have the same leaf length as the product images show.",
